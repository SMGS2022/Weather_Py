# World_Weather_Analysis

## Purpose

In utilizing the OpenWeatherMap, I was able to perform an API call, generating 2,000 cities current weather standings; i.e., minimum/maximum temperature, longitude/latitude, percent humidity/cloudiness, wind speed, and weather description (fog, light rain, etc.). From there, I inputed my clients temperature preference for the vacation destination, thus relecting a narrowed list of cities with the given temperature. Hotels, cities, countries, and weathers; were achieved in creating a new data frame, encompassing the clients preferances. The client then chose four travel destinations from the list of citites, thus giving way to creating a vacation itenerary. Using the Google Directions API, I drew a travel route amongst each destination with the preferred means of travel being, driving. My client can now see the map of the desired destinations, hotels, temperature, country, and city. 

## Results
